## The Purpose
I have created this application to validate **the degree of my knowledge in [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) (MongoDB, Express.js, React/Redux, Node.js)**, as well as my **ability to understand and integrate third-party libraries written in JavaScript**. The result is a full-stack web app that simulates the workflow of an online pizza store where both guests and registered members can customise and add pizzas, and add drinks and sides to their basket to place orders online.

> Though I am the sole author of this application, I have used an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that I have previously created for a C# portfolio as a model. This saved me some time. However, it also made me understand better the components that make up the MERN stack since at every step of the way I was able to compare it with a framework that I am already fluent in. 
> 
> After having produced a minimal viable product of sorts, I have *not* spent more time on it to improve on some shortcomings that I would not have condoned with my current knowledge and experience â€“ such as using a *React* state to store the basket's state, which causes the basket to reset on page refresh.

## Running the App

### Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
4. In order to run either the frontend or the backend, you must provide some environment variables. dotenv is installed on both projects, so you can just create a .env file in both the frontend and the backend folders, and declare the environment variables within them. For a list of required environment variables, please see the .env-sample file in each folder.

### The Backend
1. Inside a terminal, navigate into the *backend* folder. 
    - `cd backend`
2. Run a local MongoDB instance.
    - `mongod --dbpath db`
3. Keep the database running, and create a new tab inside your terminal.
    - Usually **[CMD + T]** on Mac, or **[CTRL + T]** on Windows.
4. Make sure you are still inside the *backend* folder, and install dependencies.
    - `yarn install` or `npm install`
5. Run the app.
    - `yarn start` or `npm start`

### The Frontend
1. Keep the database and the backend running, and create a new tab inside your terminal.
    - Usually **[CMD + T]** on Mac, or **[CTRL + T]** on Windows.
2. Navigate into the *frontend* folder.
    - `cd frontend` from the root, or `cd ../frontend` from the *backend* folder
3. Install dependencies.
    - `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Run the app.
    - `yarn start` or `npm start`

That's it! If all your environment variables checks out and you have followed the instructions, the frontend app must now be running at *http://localhost:3000*, and the backend app at *http://localhost:8000*.

## Running the Tests
To run the backend and the frontend tests respectively, execute the `yarn test` or the `npm test` command within the *backend* and the *frontend* folders. The state of these tests aren't perfect by the time I'm writing this, but I will soon fix them if time permits.
