## The Purpose
I have created this application to validate **the degree of my knowledge in [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) (MongoDB, Express.js, React/Redux, Node.js)**, as well as my **ability to understand and integrate third-party libraries written in JavaScript**. The result is a full-stack web app that simulates the workflow of an online pizza store where both guests and registered members can customise and add pizzas, and add drinks and sides to their basket to place orders online.

> Though I am the sole author of this application, I have used an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that I have previously created for a C# portfolio as a model. This saved me some time. However, it also made me understand better the components that make up the MERN stack since at every step of the way I was able to compare it with a framework that I am already fluent in. 
> 
> After having produced a minimal viable product of sorts, I have *not* spent more time on it to improve on some shortcomings that I would not have condoned with my current knowledge and experience â€“ such as using a *React* state to store the basket's state, which causes the basket to reset on page refresh.
