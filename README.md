This fictional pizza store application has been created to validate **the degree of my knowledge in [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)**, as well as my **ability to understand and integrate third-party libraries written in JavaScript**. In an effort to prove these points, I have created a full-stack application that simulates the workflow of an online pizza store.

> Disclaimer: Though I am the sole author of this app, I have used an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that I have previously created for a C# portfolio as a model. This saved me some time. However, it also made me understand better the components that make up the MERN stack since at every step of the way I was able to compare it with a framework that I am already fluent in.
