# Blazin Pizza CO.

## Aim and Purpose
This fictional pizza store application has been created to validate **the degree of my knowledge in [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)**, as well as my **ability to understand and integrate third-party libraries written in JavaScript**. In an effort to prove these points, I have created a full-stack application that simulates the workflow of an online pizza store.

> Disclaimer: Though I am the sole author of this app, I have used an ASP.NET MVC 5 application that I have previously created for a C# portfolio as a model. This saved me some time. However, it also made me understand better the components that make up the MERN stack since at every step of the way I was able to compare it with a framework that I am already fluent in.

## Dependencies
Below is a list of all the external libraries used in creating this app, as well as links to their web pages, descriptions of what they are and explanations on what they're used for.

### Shared Dependencies (Client and Server)
- [**ESLint (AirBnB)**](https://eslint.org/): ESLint is a JavaScript linter. I used it to ensure that I write my code in an idiomatic and consistent manner. I chose the *AirBnB* configuration because I personally prefer the style of code it enforces â€“ required semi-colons at the end of each line, single-quotes for JS strings, etc.

### Client Dependencies
- [**React Router**](https://reactrouter.com/): A collection of navigational components that alows for a declarative composition of our app. I used this library to add routing and navigation to this app. You can find the usages of this library in `App.jsx` and `Order.jsx` inside the client project.
- [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios): Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that provides a simple JavaScript interface for making HTTP calls. I used this library in the client app to make calls to the server in order to retrieve data to be rendered on pages.

TODO: Finish writing this.
